# Diarization-project
In this project we were asked to build the web application that can take audio file (wav, mp3) as an input and produce the text transcription that tags the different people in the meeting and time-stamp of each speaker. Also, the number of speakers should be dynamic that means any person can join the meeting dynamically. With Intelligent MOMs, it become very easy to get the transcription of the meeting and summary as well.

How Diarizer solved the problem of getting MOMs?

To get Intelligent MOMs I had developed the web application named Diarizer that takes audio file (audio file can be of any length and supports wav, mp3 format). In the Diarizer you simply input the audio file, meeting start time, meeting title. After submitting you will be forwarded to the next page that have speaker tags as speaker0, speaker1. And you can change the tags (option is provided) to real names. Also, the time stamp for each speaker is provided. After changing the speaker tags to real names, you can apply changes and on the next page you will get the transcription as well as the summary.
